    "    - **Prompt Template:** \n",
    "        - This is the base prompt that is sent to the LLM once the prompty is executed. \n",
    "        - It uses Jinja format to pass values either specified in the front matter or from the application to the LLM.\n",
    "        - Given *'name': Marlene*, the variable *{{name}}* will be replaced by *Marlene* at runtime. \n",
