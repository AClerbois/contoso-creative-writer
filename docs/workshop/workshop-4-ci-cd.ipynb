    "## 4. Setting up automated evaluations and deployment with Github Actions \n",
    "\n",
    "Contoso Creative Writer is set up to run a CI/CD pipeline, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample code the CI/CD pipeline includes the following: \n",
    "1. **Build and Deploy:** Automatically building and deploying the latest version of the code in production (This helps us confirm things are working as expected.)\n",
    "2. **Evaulations:** Automatically running evaulations on a test article to see how fluent, grounded, relevant and coherent the final response was.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to run automated evaluations and deployment \n",
    "- [ ] Step 1: Set up the azd pipeline configuration\n",
    "- [ ] Step 2: Allow workflows in Github\n",
    "- [ ] Step 3: Examine evaluations \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1:** Set up the azd pipeline configuration\n",
    "We will set up the CI/CD pipeline with azd and GitHub actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks...\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<img src=\"todo.png\" alt=\"todo icon\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\"> **Tasks for you to do:**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To do this **open a new terminal**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```shell\n",
    "    azd pipeline config\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- select an environment name like yourname-aitour (it may auto detect this and not ask.)\n",
    "- select the recommended subscription by pressing enter\n",
    "- select `Canada East` as the Azure Location \n",
    "- When asked to Log in using the Github CLI type in `Y`\n",
    "- Choose `HTTPS` as the preferred protocol for Git Operations \n",
    "- Select `Y` to Authenticate with your Github credentials. \n",
    "- Choose Login with a web browser to authenticate Github CLI and follow the authentication instructions. \n",
    "- You may be asked if you want to commit and push your local changes. Choose `Y`\n",
    "- You should see two links in your terminal. Select the sencond link to view your pipeline status. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2:** Allow workflows in Github\n",
    "You will now see a screen in Github that tells you workflows are not being run on the fork. \n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks...\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<img src=\"todo.png\" alt=\"todo icon\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\"> **Tasks for you to do:**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click the green button that says `understand my workflows go ahead and enable them.`\n",
    "- If the screen is blank come back to the terminal and rerun the *azd pipeline config* command. \n",
    "- Again, select the sencond link to view your pipeline status. \n",
    "- You should now see the two Github action workflows running on the screen. \n",
    "- Look at the subheading of the actions and wait till the **Evaluate** one turns green. \n",
    "- It will likely take a few minutes to complete but once complete click the Evaulate action. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3:** Examine evaluations\n",
    "You should see a table with some scores for relevance, fluencey, coherence and groundedness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks...\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<img src=\"todo.png\" alt=\"todo icon\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\"> **Tasks for you to do:**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The scores are from 1-5, with 5 being the highest mark. These are used to help us know how well the model is performing.\n",
    "- Examine the evaluations and think of some ways you might be able to improve a score in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Congratulations you've succesfully automated evaluations and deploymentüéâ\n",
    "\n",
